Electronic toll collection (ETC) aims to eliminate the delay on expressway by collecting user fee electronically. 
ETC determines whether the cars passing are enrolled in the program,
electronically debits the accounts of registered car owners and open gates automatically without requiring them to stop.

How ETC works:
The ETC card is loaded with an IC chip that identifies the person paying tolls and records the data necessary to make payment on the toll. 
These cards are issued by credit card companies. The ETC in-vehicle device is installed in the car.

Advantages:
Do not have to stay in long lines to pass through.

Disadvantages:
Bigger vehichles will get scanned first due to height issues which leaves them at a disadvantage ( will elaborate)

Features - Electronic toll collection systems rely on four major components: automated vehicle identification, 
automated vehicle classification, transaction processing, and violation enforcement. 
The four components are somewhat independent, and, in fact, some toll agencies have contracted out functions separately.
Shortcomings - The disadvantage is that fully automatic recognition has a significant error rate, leading to billing errors. 
Conversely, systems that incorporate a manual review stage have much lower error rates, but require a continuing staffing expense.
Strengths - Electronic toll collection system is very fast and efficient mode for collection of toll charges at the toll plazas. 
This saves a lot of time since vehicles passing through the toll plaza do not stop to pay toll and the payment automatically takes 
place from the account of the vehicle.
